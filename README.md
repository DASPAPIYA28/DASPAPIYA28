About Me

I'm a computational biologist with expertise in multi-omics data analysis, focusing on neurodegenerative diseases. I integrate bioinformatics, machine learning, and wet-lab validation to uncover disease mechanisms and therapeutic targets.


Research Focus:

Variant calling and pathogenicity prediction in neurological diseases

Multi-omics integration (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics)

Structural bioinformatics and molecular dynamics simulations

Translational cancer genomics
